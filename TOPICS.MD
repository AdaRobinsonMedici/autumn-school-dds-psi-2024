# TOPICS FOR GROUP PROJECTS

**Deliverables applicable to all topics**:
- A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the use of the model.
- A documentation of the model.
- A test suite that ensures the model is working as expected.

Given groups of 4 to 5 persons, it is possible and recommended to develop each of
the above-listed deliverables in parallel. The use of Activity Browser is permitted
to see the databases and visualize the results of the model, or to support you in setting the project up.

Here are a few suggested topics.
You may come up with your own topic and form a group around it.

## Topic 1: Dynamic inventory: `temporalis`

**Description**: Build a dynamic inventory to represent the life-cycle of
a battery electric car. The inventory should include the production of the
car, its use phase, and its end-of-life phase. The inventory should be
implemented using the `temporalis` library and distribute the material and
energy flows over time. This model should be reproducible, tested and documented.

## Topic 2: Mass and Flow Analysis: `ODYM`

**Description**: Build a model to represent the mass and flow analysis of primary 
and secondary steel production in Europe (tracking steel scrap volumes). Inform a 
premise custom scenario with the results of the mass and flow analysis. 
The custom scenario should then be used to create a prospective LCA database and 
time-sensitive market datasets for steel (primary vs. secondary steel supply).
You can alternatively simply use `wurst` for the database manipulation part.

## Topic 3: The Montreal Protocol

**Description**: Build a premise custom scenario to represent the Montreal Protocol
implementation across world regions and time. Phase out ozone-depleting substances
and replace them with alternatives. The model should include the production of
alternatives, their use phase, and the end-of-life phase. Provide comparative 
assessment of the environmental impacts/benefits of the Montreal Protocol 
implementation.

## Topic 4: Circular Economy

**Description**: Build a model or a premise custom scenario to represent the implementation
of different Circular Economy strategies in a region: reuse, recycle, recover. Waste treatment
activities should be modified according to the Circular Economy strategies. The model should
be able to compare the environmental impacts of the different strategies. Preferable, the strategies
should target a product, a family of products or a material that is not currently managed in a circular
way.

## Topic 5: Sensitivity Analysis

**Description**: Build a model to represent the sensitivity analysis of the environmental impacts
of a product. The model should be able to modify the input parameters of the product and assess
the impact on the environmental indicators. The model should be able to compare the environmental
impacts of the different scenarios.
