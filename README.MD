## Course Overview
Open-source tools help us realize the true potential of life cycle assessment (LCA). 
These tools facilitate cloud calculations, uncertainty and sensitivity assessment, 
parametric modeling, external model interfaces, spatial and temporal assessment, 
scenario-based and prospective assessment, hybridization of multiple databases, 
and database modeling perspectives.

In this autumn school, we will build on these open-source foundations, focusing 
on Brightway, Wurst, and Premise (and maybe Temporalis if there is interest), 
to make our inventory models better fit research questions with a temporal 
dimension. The instructors will be:

- **Romain Sacchi**: Developer of Premise
- **Karin Treyer**: Spearheads Brightway’s online learning materials focusing on novice users
- **Chris Mutel**: Lead developer of Brightway
- **Alvaro Hahn-Menacho**: Expert in integrating Mass Flow Analysis (using ODYM) in prospective LCA

The course will cover Brightway’s basics and best practices for model development, 
including the use of Jupyter notebooks and the Activity Browser. 
Essential LCA aspects such as sensitivity analysis, multiple types of 
uncertainty, parametrization, and best practices in software architecture 
will be taught. This includes documentation standards, testing, data and 
source version control, linting, and quick tool builders like Panel and Dash. 
These concepts will be applied while diving deep into Premise and writing 
parameterized models to generate custom scenario data.

## Course Structure
The week starts with three interactive teaching sessions using Jupyter 
Notebooks, Git, and other tools needed to properly develop, test, 
and document LCA models. These notebooks include exercises, and solutions 
will be discussed in class. From Thursday to Friday, you will work in 
groups of around five people on small group projects, applying these ideas. 
Short teaching inputs will support the group work. Groups will present 
their results on Friday afternoon.

## Target Audience
This autumn school is aimed at students who wish to become familiar with 
the Brightway ecosystem, specifically targeting beginner and intermediate 
users. Students who complete the school will receive a certificate for 2 
ETCS credit points. Enrollment is limited to 30 people.

## Location
The summer school will be held at the Möschberg seminar hotel, in Grosshöchstetten, 
Switzerland. This hotel is located outside the village, offering views south 
towards the Bernese Alps. Möschberg emphasizes local and organic food for its guests.

## Python Preparation
A basic understanding of Python is necessary for the school. Brightway offers 
training and documentation online. Students should review those materials 
and some Python training before the school starts.

## Schedule
- **Starting Time**: The school starts at 09:00 on Monday. It is most convenient to arrive on 
the 8:04 train into Grosshöchstetten (or the day before).
- **Ending Time**: The school ends at 17:00 on Friday. An Apéro with snacks and drinks will 
- be offered on Friday evening. You can contact the hotel if you wish to stay 
- Friday night or arrive before Monday morning.

For more information, please see the [schedule](SCHEDULE.MD).

## Instructions Before Arrival
Ideally, do this **at least one week before the course starts**, 
so that you have time to ask/write us questions if you encounter any issues.
Please read the [INSTRUCTIONS.MD](INSTRUCTIONS.MD) file in this repository.

## Project topics
During the group projects, you will be asked to work on a topics.
You may choose a topic of your own and form a group around it.
Or you may choose one of the topics described in [TOPICS.MD](TOPICS.MD).
Please acquaint yourself with the topics before the school starts.
